#Assessment 3 Part 1 and part 2
Unit :-SLE 712 Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Techniques

#Aim of the Assignment
Class demonstration about how to use git hub via RStudio was done.The main aim of the assignment is to run codes to import the files,perform functions,create histogram and box plot in part 1.Similarly,to test the blast limit ,download files and compress and unzip it and to perform functions for mutations and mismatch determination in part 2.After that commiting the files in Github.

#Motivation
This assignment helps us to learn GitHub amd markdown format.

#Contents
It consists of the following files
Part A and Part A2 of part 1
Part 2 library.R
Readme
License

In part 1,From questions 1 to 5, firstly "gene_expression.tsv" file is downloaded.From the file mean and histogram were plotted.Similary from questions 6 to 10,"growth_data.csv" file is downloaded.From the file the mean of the data provided was calculated and the box plot was plotted.Also,the p-value of the northeast and southwest over a period of 10 years was estimated by t.test and wilcox functions.

 A file of whole set of e.coli was downloaded and the file was decompressed and blast database was made.After that the sample file was downloaded to obtain a desired sequence as per the allocated sequence.From the sample file various functions were made for blast and fasta and to perform manipulations and mutations to obtain the result.
