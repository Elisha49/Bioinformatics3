#Assessment 3 Part 1 and part 2

Unit :-SLE 712 Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Techniques

#Aim of the Assignment

Part 1:- The main aim of the assignment is to develop problem solving skills by learning to use git hub and Rstudio ,run codes to import the files,perform functions,create histogram and box plot in part 1.Also to work together as ateam using Rstudio and GitHub.

Part 2:- The main aim is to download and unzip files,Perform simple manipulations and analyses with sequence data,incorporate point mutations and perform a BLAST search and interpret result by using the functions. After that commiting the files in Github.

#Motivation

This assignment helps us to learn GitHub amd markdown format.It helps to know the importance of R and BlAST interms of Biotechnology.

#Contents

It consists of the following files
Part A and Part A2 of part 1
Part 2 library.R
Readme
License

In part 1,From questions 1 to 5, firstly "gene_expression.tsv" file is downloaded.From the file mean and histogram were plotted.Similary from questions 6 to 10,"growth_data.csv" file is downloaded.From the file the mean of the data provided was calculated and the box plot was plotted.Also,the p-value of the northeast and southwest over a period of 10 years was estimated by t.test and wilcox functions.

 A file of whole set of e.coli was downloaded and the file was decompressed and blast database was made.After that the sample file was downloaded to obtain a desired sequence as per the allocated sequence.From the sample file various functions were made for blast and fasta and to perform manipulations and mutations to obtain the result.


#Installation
